Music Genre Classification using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify music genres using machine learning techniques. We utilize the GTZAN Dataset for a diverse range of genres. Our approach includes K-Nearest Neighbors for initial distance calculations and Support Vector Machines for robust classification. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, F-score, and AUC. Team roles: Vivan Chopra (ML algorithms, model evaluation), Umme Fatema Piu (data processing, cross-validation), Rahul Menon (implementation, testing).
